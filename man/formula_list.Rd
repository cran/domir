\description{
Defines a list object composed of \code{formula}s. The purpose of this
class of object is to impose structure of the list to ensure that it
can be used to obtain RHS-LHS pairs and will be able to be
parsed in \code{\link{domir}}.
}
\details{
The \code{formula_list} requires that each element of the list is a \code{formula}
and that each \code{formula} is unique with a different, non-\code{NULL}
dependent variable/response.
